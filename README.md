# NVMSorting

## Running the code

**Note: Please change the target file paths in ```GenerateData.cpp``` and ```SplitSort.cpp``` before attempting to run the bash scripts**

### 1. Generating data to be sorted in NVM
**Generated data should be on NVM, and is currently set to "/dcpmm/yida/UNSORTED_KEYS" by default**. By default, the script creates a 16GB (2^29 items) sized file of 32-byte sized Records (key, val) in NVM.
Usage:
```bash GenerateData.sh```

### 2. Running the algorithm on the generated data
**Target file to sort should be on NVM, and needs to match the generated data's file path.** The number of items to be sorted needs to be specified as command line arguments to the program. Please edit the ```SortData.sh``` bash file directly if you wish to run different experimental setups.
Usage:
```bash SortData.sh```
